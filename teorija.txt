U React.js a component is a piece of code that represents a part of a user interface.
It can be a class component or a funcional component.
Class component is a js class that extends React.component class, while a funcional
component is a js.
function that returns only the React element.

A PureComponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component,
but with aditional features
or optimizations,When a component is a PureComponent,
React will do a shallow comparison of the props and 
state before re-rendering the component.That mean that if props and state
have not cahanged,the component
will not be re-rendering.This can lead to a performance boost in some cases,
but if its not use propertly,
it can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Bottomline, component is the most basic and most used for building
a block in React and PureComponent
is used when it needs some special optimizations.

Props(properties) is a way for manipulating data and states
We can send data thtought props and we can send data to parent
